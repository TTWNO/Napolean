Code for Napolean project. This will allow blind people to be able to read books with the power of Raspiberry Pis

Splits an image (meant to be taken by the picam of an open book) takes an image, splits it down the middle, and grayscales it.

Outputs left.jpg and right.jpg

##### get_text_of_both.sh
Uses Tesseract (OCR) to extract text from each side of the picture (assumes left.jpg, right.jpg)

Outputs left.txt and right.txt

##### StreamingCam.py
Runs a local web server to view the current camera output

##### take_picture.sh \<filename\>
Kills the webserver to unlock the camera. Takes image. Restarts web server.

Everything in the JPG folder are reference images to make aure that all the software is working.

Crops an image in the centre. Assuming the width and height of the camera to be 16.5, and 12 inches respectivelyâ€”for now anyway.
